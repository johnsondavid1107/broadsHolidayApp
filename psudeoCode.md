# Holiday App Idea
the base idea is an application that can be used by anyone, desktop or ideally mobile, to allow the user to keep track of the xmas presents they buy, who they are for, when they are wrapped, and delete when given.  




## Database info
Need to create a table for each user.  The table should have first name, last name, password and email stored in the database.  Then, using passport.js the user logs in and given access to home page.

Need to create a table of notes.  The notes table needs to be tied to the user that logs in.  So, when the user logs in, it will display all of the people built, and their xmas list items



## Passport.js



## Front End
need to have a signup page, a login page and a home page

The signup page needs to have user table data, firstName lastName, email and password inputs.  The Signup should also have a how-to breif overview of application.

The login page should use passport.js to authenticate user

Home page should display all of the user that logged ins content.  should show the list of people built and the xmas items purchased for each person.  Working links to logout

## JS Ideas
maybe I can use two different save buttons, one to create entries and another to update entires
